- Open any GUI (Inventory/resource with inventory) With this mod enabled and the gui will pop up!

- "Delay Packets" Delays the packets being sent to the server successfully.
- "Send Packets" Stop packets being sent to the server for your actions.
- "Copy JSON" Copies your Json information to a file.
- "De-Sync" Closes a GUI Server-side but will keep it open for the player.
